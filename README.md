# Hey there! I'm Amin ðŸ™‚
A `Frontend Developer` with over four years of experience, specialized in `React` and `NextJS`, occasionally enjoying `Angular`.


I also have some backend development and DevOps skills under my belt. I've used `relational` and `non-relational` and used different `ORM`s like `mongoose` and `SQLite`, and set up servers with `ExpressJS` and `NestJS`.

Normally, I set up my own `CI/CD` pipeline.

This page is a work in progress, and I'll be adding more content gradually. 
I'll try to keep it tidy. I say that every time!

## Interested In
Pretty much everything about software.
`Server Side Rendering`, `SEO` and setting up `CI/CD` pipelines.
I really love deploying my own apps, and adapting new technologies in each project. I can't remember two projects of mine with identic stacks.

`Performance optimization` is what I find very interesting within `Frontend development`. It's crazy how you can improve a web app by finding better architectural choices and data structures.
