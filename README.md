# Hey there! I'm Amin ðŸ™‚
A `Frontend Developer` with around three years of experience, mainly focused on `React`. Lately, I've been enjoying working with `NextJS`.


I also have some backend development and DevOps skills under my belt. This page is a work in progress, and I'll be adding more content gradually. 


I'll try to keep it tidy. I say that every time!

## Interested In
Pretty much everything about the future, from sticking my nose into `bash` scripting (yes, it comes from the past but I don't think it'll die soon) to learning `Go` and learning `Data Structures` and optimizing `Algorithms`. I really love deploying my own apps.

`Performance optimization` is what I find very interesting within `Frontend development`.
